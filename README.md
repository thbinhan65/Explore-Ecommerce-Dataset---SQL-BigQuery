## Project Title: Explore Ecommerce Dataset
## Introduction: 

Welcome to my first project on exploring e-commerce data! This repository features the SQL script titled "Explore E-Commerce Dataset", which delves into analyzing e-commerce data using Google Analytics samples. Our goal is to derive valuable insights into customer behaviors, website performance, and transactional trends.

## Project Objective: 
Analyze and explore user behavior patterns in an eCommerce dataset through specific queries. Gain insights into website performance, customer shopping behavior, and revenue generation. Assess metrics such as total visits, bounce rates, and average transactions per user. Identify purchasing trends and conduct a cohort analysis to understand the customer journey. Use the findings to inform strategic recommendations that enhance marketing and improve customer satisfaction.

## Analysis Focus:

- Traffic Analysis:

  - Calculate total visits, page views, and transactions for January, February, and March 2017 to assess trends and changes in user behavior.
- Bounce Rate:

  - Determine the bounce rate by traffic source for July 2017 to evaluate the effectiveness of marketing channels.
- Revenue by Traffic Source:

  - Analyze weekly and monthly revenue for June 2017 to identify the highest value channels.
- Average Page Views:

  - Calculate average page views by buyer type (buyers vs. non-buyers) for June and July 2017.
- Average Transactions per User:

  - Evaluate the average number of transactions per user who made purchases in July 2017.
- Average Spend per Session:

  - Calculate the average amount spent by buyers per session, focusing on buyer data for July 2017.
- Other Products Purchased:

  - Identify other products customers bought when they purchased the "YouTube Men's Vintage Henley" in July 2017.
- Cohort Mapping:

  - Calculate cohort mapping from product views to add-to-cart and purchases for January, February, and March 2017.

## Tools and Techniques Used: 

- SQL
- BigQuery

## Execution Process: 
- Data Collection: Gather the eCommerce dataset from relevant sources and load it into BigQuery.
- Data Cleaning: Use SQL queries to clean the dataset by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
- Metric Calculation: Calculate key metrics such as total visits, bounce rates, and average transactions per user using SQL aggregation functions.
- Trend Analysis: Execute specific queries to identify purchasing trends over different time periods.
- Cohort Analysis: Perform cohort analysis to track the customer journey, focusing on user behavior from product views to purchases.

## Results Achieved: 
- Learn how to manipulate data on the BigQuery platform.
- Be able to use SQL to clean and query data according to the requirements of the task.
- Calculate the necessary metrics to serve the analysis.
- Identify insights from the data to support the next steps in the workflow.
